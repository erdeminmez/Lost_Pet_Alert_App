# Lost_Pet_Alert_App
PROG31975 Project

1.	Introduction

  Purpose of the app is to create a mobile platform to help lost pets and their owners. The target audience of the app is people who lost their pets and people who saw or collected a lost pet. People who lost their pets can share a post on the app which gives information about the lost pet and its disappearance. These posts will be listed in the app so that the people who wants to help can look this list and could contribute to finding the lost pet. In addition, the people who saw or collected a lost pet can also share a post regarding with that so that lost pet owners could find a clue with the help of this posts. Basically, there will be two post sharing screen and two post list in the app, each one of them will be belong to lost pet owners and people who wants to help to find them. 
  
  To share the location of disappearance or appearance of the lost pet quickly and precisely, iOS location services will be used. However, for the people who do not want to allow the app to access location services of their phones, manual address sharing feature will be available. 
  
  All the posts will be stored in Firebase Firestore database so that each user can access the lists of the post on cloud.
  
  Lost pet alert should be quick and efficient so there will be no user account. That mean anyone who has the app could directly share or view posts without creating or log into any account.
  
  Lastly, the iOS app will have the advanced feature of WidgetKit. For people who are trying to find their lost pet, a widget will be added. It will show the brief information of last post from a person who saw or collected a lost pet. By clicking this widget, the app will be launched. This feature will help lost pet owners not to spend their all battery while using our app.
